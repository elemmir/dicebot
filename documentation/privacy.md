# Privacy Policy for Dicebot
Last Updated: July 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy outlines how Dicebot handles information when you use the bot on Discord.

# Information We "Collect"

Dicebot is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not permanently store any of your data. However, to function, the bot temporarily processes the following information when you issue a command:

Command Location: This includes whether the command was used in a direct message (DM) or in a server. If in a server, the bot will recognise the Server Name and ID.

Your Discord Information: Your Discord Username, Discord Nickname and DiscordUser ID are temporarily processed to attribute the command to you.

Command Content: The number of dice you roll and any description you provide for the roll are processed to execute the command.

Button Interactions: Any interactions with buttons provided by the bot are also temporarily processed to respond to your actions.

# How We Use Your Information

The information listed above is used solely for the purpose of executing your command and displaying the result. This data is also temporarily displayed in a command window on the hosting server. This data is not stored in a database or any permanent storage.

# Data Retention
All information processed by Dicebot is temporary. The output in the command window is regularly wiped clean. We do not maintain any historical data of commands or user interactions.

# Data Sharing
We do not share any of your information with third parties. As we do not store your data, there is nothing to share.

# Your Rights
Since we do not store your personal data, the typical rights to access, rectify, or erase data are not applicable. There is no data to provide, change, or delete.

# Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.

# Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the Administrator team via the Prowlers & Paragons Discord Server (https://discord.gg/gwwEZ2e).
